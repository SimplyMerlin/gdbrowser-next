# GDBrowser with next

This is an app bootstrapped according to the [init.tips](https://init.tips) stack, also known as the T3-Stack.

# Okay, what happened?

My goal was to make a mobile friendly next based version of GDBrowser. Sadly it seems that RobTop has blocked vercel servers. I don't feel like working around this.
